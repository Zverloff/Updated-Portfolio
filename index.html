                <p>These are the words that will tell the story of my life. They will be boring and likely barely glanced at by any interested parties. Many will try very hard to make theirs unique and quirky, but few will care. Trying to be unique and being unique are very different. If you've even thought about how to be unique, then you likely aren't. To be unique is to be unaware of those around you and do as you wish. It is to soar above the crowd and pay it no mind. Or maybe it's not. Who knows?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here are more words about me. It's hard to break down your exisitence into a paragraph or two, especially when those paragraphs are going to be used by others to judge you and your worth. How can any person be distilled down into two simple paragraphs?</p>
